<!--When adding an audio element to html, two different formats were chosen (mp4 and ogg)
this is mainly because different browsers only support certain formats. Giving multiple
formats increases the chance of the viewer being able to listen to the audio without an
external source. However just incase a viewers browser does not support the given formats,
it is made available for a message to appear with a link to the youtube video address that
sources the audio file. The way this message comes up is the browser will work its way down
the source list within the video element (mp3 first then ogg) if the browser doesn't
support these, it will then show the message as that is the last thing in the element.
A .wav format was not chosen for this due to the files of a .wav being too large.
Putting controls in the coding ensures that the user can control the video
through a play button and volume.
