of this image seperately and differently to the others-->

<!--The only reason this h6 element was placed here was to create spacing between
the header and the navigation bar. Although padding could of been used to create this effect.
The padding would negatively effect the look which was trying to be achieved. Either through
creating the navigation bar to large or offsetting the text within the navigation bar.
The reason the h6 was used specifically was because its the smallest heading element, meaning
it has the smallest spacing, and it was meant the p element was needed. If the p element
was used, the styling rules (that were not wanted) here would of been applied.-->

  <p>"In a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is
      divided into 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young
      representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate
      in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a
      past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem.
      The 24 participants are forced toeliminate their competitors while the
      citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss'
      young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative,
      Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart, Peeta,
      are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have
      trained for this their whole lives."

<!--When adding a video element to html, two different formats were chosen (mp4 and webm)
this is mainly because different browsers only support certain formats. Giving multiple
formats increases the chance of the viewer being able to watch the video without an
external source. However just incase a viewers broweser does not support the given formats
it is made available for a message to appear with a link to the youtube video address.
The way this message comes up is the browser will work its way down the source list
within the video element (mp4 first then webm) if the browser doesn't support these,
it will then show the message as that is the last thing in the element. A poster
element has also been used to change the thumnail of the video from a random freeze frame to
the film poster. Putting controls in the coding ensures that the user can control the video
through a play button and volume.-->
      <video controls poster="img/thehungergames.jpg">
        <source src="vid/TheHungerGames.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          <source src="vide/TheHungerGames.webm" type="video/webm">
            I'm sorry your browser does not support the video format,
            but you can watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfmrPu43DF8">Here</a>
      </video>

<!--Using external links to link the user to a viewing website seemed
appropriate as it is often used to allow the user to easy find the film if they
are interested in watching it. It was put on the home page after the trailer as it
is usually after the trailer when someone decides if they want to see the film.
YouTube and Prime Video were chosen as the external links due to the popularity
of the platforms. Although there may be bigger platforms they did not necesarily
have the film available.-->

      <p>If you would like to watch the full film, follow one of the links
      below</p>
<!--These two links are displayed as images, meaning the user will recognise the logo,
and can choose the platform quicker, as the human brain processes an image faster than
text. They have been put in different classes, meaning i can edit them seperately and have
different styles attached to it.-->
